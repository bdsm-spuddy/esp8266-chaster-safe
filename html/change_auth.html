<form method=post action=safe/ enctype="multipart/form-data">
To set the user name and password needed to access the safe:
<br>
Safe Username: <input name=username size=40 value="##ui_username##">
<br>
Safe Password: <input name=password size=40>  (keep blank to leave unchanged)
<p>
<input type=submit value="Set Auth Details" name=setauth>

If the change is accepted, you will need to login again.
<hr>
To talk to the Chaster Server you need to enter your API Developer token
details.  See the README on how to find this
<br>
Developer token: <input name=token size=40 value="##token##">
<p>
<input type=submit value="Set API Details" name=setapi>
<p>
If the values are incorrect you will not be able to talk to the server
and will need to correct the values.
<p>
The default endpoint this software talks to is the Chaster API.
This may be changed here (if no lock is running) to another endpoint
that supports the <tt>checklock.php</tt> endpoint.  NOTE: the server
must also use the same CA so we can do secure communication.
